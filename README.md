To execute this code, follow these steps:

Ensure that the necessary libraries and packages are installed in your Python environment. The required libraries include OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn.

Ensure that the image files are organized correctly in the images/train and images/validation directories. The images should be stored in subdirectories named after the emotion they represent (angry, disgusted, fear, happy, sad, surprised, neutral).

Import the necessary libraries at the beginning of the script and use the code given in notebook on this link - https://github.com/Abhismoothie/Data-Mining-Asgnmnt-1/blob/main/nsjbc%20%20(2).ipynb
